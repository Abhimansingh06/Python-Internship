# Python Internship – Learning Journey 🚀

## 📌 About This Repository
This repository contains all the tasks, projects, and exercises I worked on during my **Python Internship**.  
The goal of this internship was to strengthen my understanding of Python programming, backend development, and practical project implementation.

## 🧑‍💻 What I Learned
Throughout the internship, I gained hands-on experience in:

- ✅ Core Python concepts (data types, loops, functions, OOP, error handling)  
- ✅ Working with **virtual environments** and dependency management  
- ✅ Using **Git & GitHub** for version control and collaboration  
- ✅ Building **REST APIs** using **FastAPI / Flask**  
- ✅ Database integration with **SQLite / PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLAlchemy**  
- ✅ Authentication & JWT handling
